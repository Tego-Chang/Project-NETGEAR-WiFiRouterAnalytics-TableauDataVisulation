# Project-NETGEAR-WiFiRouterAnalytics-TableauDataVisulation

Wi-Fi Router Analytics (Wi-Fi RA) - a project about collecting and analyzing the data during wireless connections between Netgear Wi-Fi routers and users’ devices - was where I led an eight-member team with Agile methodology to experience real-life data analysis in three stages: 1) data development, 2) data verification, and 3) data visualization for decision-making. In the first stage, we designed and implemented the data collection function; In the data verification stage, we examined the collected data and tried to detect potential program errors, including incorrect data formats or crashes during collection; In the final stage, data visualization for decision-making, we released Wi-Fi RA to consumers’ units through software update. Based on the collected information from the public, I built Tableau charts and interpreted them for various engineering improvements and business purposes.

The project was a success. My interpretation embodied what happened during the invisible wireless transmissions - the most important topic for Netgear, well-known for its robust wireless performance. During the entire process, I was fascinated with providing insights from data since I found as long as we clearly define and verify the data we want, it can tell us the truth beyond our subjective observations.
